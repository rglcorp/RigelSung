![Decorative Banner](assets/banner.png)

This is a CJK typeface based on the [GenRyuMinTW v2.1](https://github.com/ButTaiwan/genryu-font) font (SemiBold variant), designed for use by the Rigel Corporation for in-game wayfinding signages.

Modification including a slightly heavier font weight, and minor modification to the writing of some CJK characters (Such as 天/九/鐘).

2 variant is provided in the `dist/` directory: **Normal** and **Lite** version. The **Lite** version contains most of the commonly used CJK characters (Except Hanja), and are suitable for embedding in applications/web where file size is a concern.
